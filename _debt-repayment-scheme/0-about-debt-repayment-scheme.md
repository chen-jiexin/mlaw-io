Debt Repayment Scheme (DRS)
---
The Debt Repayment Scheme (“DRS”) is a pre-bankruptcy scheme which is administered by the Official Assignee under the Bankruptcy Act (Chapter 20).<br>

It seeks a win-win outcome for both the debtor and his creditor. Debtors with unsecured debts not exceeding $100,000 will be able to enter into a debt repayment plan (“DRP”) under the DRS with their creditors and avoid bankruptcy, along with its restrictions and social stigma.<br>

The proposed DRP must ensure that the interests of creditors are adequately safeguarded. These debtors will commit to the DRP and repay their debts over a fixed period of time of not more than 5 years. When the debtor meets his financial obligations under the DRS, he will be released from his debts and have a fresh start thereafter.<br>
