Duties and Responsibilities of a Bankrupt
---

1. Contributions to Bankruptcy Estate

(a) Must I contribute any income to my bankruptcy estate?
If you are gainfully employed, you must make a monthly contribution to your bankruptcy estate for the benefit of your creditors. The contributions will be accumulated in your bankruptcy estate and will be distributed to your creditors upon your discharge from bankruptcy.

 

The amount and the frequency of payments you make to your bankruptcy estate is an important factor considered by the Official Assignee when reviewing your case to determine your suitability for discharge from bankruptcy.

 

(b) How much do I have to contribute my bankruptcy estate?
The Official Assignee will assess the amount which you will be required to pay each month after taking into account what you reasonably need for yourself and your family.

 

You will be required to submit your Income Declaration declaring information on your occupation, income and list of dependants when you attend the Official Assignee’s office to file your Statement of Affairs. You will also need to update this information online by filing your Statement of Monies and Properties received every six months.

 

(c) What are the payment modes for my monthly instalment payments?
You may make your monthly instalment payment through GIRO, Self-service Automated Machines (SAMs), SingPost counters, and cash, NETS or Cashcard at our office.


Please note that the Service Centre’s counter operating hours are:

Monday to Friday: 8.30am to 5.00pm

(Closed on Weekends & Public Holidays)

(d) How can I find out how much I have to paid into my bankruptcy account altogether?
You may access the e-services portal (Individual Insolvency Administration Information) at our website and obtain the information, at no charge.

2. Travelling Overseas
Expand AllCollapse All
(a) Can I travel overseas?
You are allowed to leave Singapore or remain overseas after obtaining the approval of the Official Assignee. If you attempt to travel overseas without the Official Assignee's permission, you may be stopped by the Controller of Immigration from leaving Singapore and your passport may be impounded by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority.

(b) How do I apply for permission to travel overseas?
If you wish to leave Singapore, you should apply online at least 14 days before your departure date to obtain the Official Assignee’s permission, stating the reason for your travel, your destination of travel and your period of travel.

 

You will also need to submit documents in respect of your travel application if required by the Official Assignee. For example, if you are travelling for employment purposes, you need to submit your letter of employment or a company letter supporting the reason for your travel.

(c) What if I need to travel urgently?
If you need to travel urgently, you are still required to apply for permission online and thereafter contact your officer to obtain confirmation on the approval status of your travel application.

(d) What if I need to travel frequently?
If you have to travel frequently, you may apply for block periods of travel subject to your conduct in bankruptcy.

(e) How do I find out the status of my latest travel application?
You may access the e-services portal (Individual Insolvency Administration Information) at our website and obtain the information at no charge.

3. Managing a Business or Becoming a Director

(a) Can I manage a business or a corporation?
You may apply to the High Court or to the Official Assignee for permission to:

 

i.     Manage or take part in any business under the Business Registration Act (Chapter 32); or

Each application will be considered on its own merit. The Official Assignee will take into consideration a number of factors including:

the cause of your bankruptcy;
your conduct before and during bankruptcy;
your previous involvement in the business or corporation;
the nature and viability of the proposed business or corporation;
the nature of your involvement in the business or corporation;
the benefits to your creditors from your involvement in the business or corporation;
the risk of you incurring more debt from running the business or corporation.
 



The Official Assignee may refuse the application or approve the application subject to conditions she may impose. Such conditions may include requesting that you maintain proper accounting records and make regular payments to the Official Assignee from the income or profits of the business or corporation for the benefit of creditors.

 

(d) How do I find out the status of my application to manage a business or corporation?
You may access the e-services portal (Individual Insolvency Administration Information) at our website and obtain the information at no charge.

4. Categorising and Zones
Expand AllCollapse All
(a) Will I be categorised based on my conduct in bankruptcy?
Yes.
